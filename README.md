This APP is to display the most and least popular names from 1880 to 2006 in the U.S. where the newborn individual has a social security number.

The main panel shows two types of presentation of the data: 

1. Point graph with frequency of the names as y-axis and each name as x-axis. The point size is scaled according to their relative frequency within that set of data.
2. Wordcloud which allows viewer to have a more qualitative sense of the name trend


The sidebar panel has the following options for the viewer to choose the data they are interested:

1. Sex: the viewer can choose male or female
2. Year: due the limit of Shiny app, we only present the data from 1880 to 2006 with a interval of 9 years. This allows the viewer to see the change of trend of the baby names for different decades
3. Type of order: the viewer can choose from the most popular baby names as well as the least ones. 

**Note: sometimes it takes a little bit longer to load the data. If the plot does not update as you change the options, you could wait a little bit.**
